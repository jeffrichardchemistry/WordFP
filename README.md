# WordFP
This application consists of a python package made to encode words and compare them through similarity calculation.
The words are encoded in a matrix of 0's and 1's called "WordFP", where the first column refers to all the letters
present in a word and the second column to the last refers to the position of a certain letter in a word.
The search for similar words is calculated based on the metrics: geometric, arithmetic, tanimoto and tversky.
